## About 

EduOgmaNeo is a heavily simplified, feature-incomplete version of [AOgmaNeo](https://github.com/ogmacorp/AOgmaNeo) written entirely in Python with just Numpy.
It is intended as an educational version of SPH (Sparse Predictive Hierarchies) that gets the basic ideas across.
For real-world usage, please use [AOgmaNeo](https://github.com/ogmacorp/AOgmaNeo).
